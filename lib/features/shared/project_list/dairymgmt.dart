  aboutProject:
      "This project was developed during my second-year internship as part of my Diploma in Computer Science. It was my first real exposure to Java, MySQL, and the NetBeans IDE. As a solo project, I was responsible for everythingâ€”from database design to UI and business logic.\nBuilding this app was not just a technical exercise but a defining moment in my journey. It gave me confidence and laid the foundation for my future projects in app development.",
  challeges: [
    "Dashboard logic was complex to structure and update dynamically:\n- Broke down the logic into modular functions and used MySQL queries to drive real-time data flow",

  outcomes: [
    "Learned the basics of Java, MySQL, and NetBeans",
    "Understood how to structure a full-scale CRUD application",
    "Created my first complete functional project",
    "Gained practical experience in building, debugging, and maintaining a desktop app",
