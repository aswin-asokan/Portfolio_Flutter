  aboutProject:
      "EazyGo was the core idea for our Diploma main project, and it was built collaboratively as a team effort. The goal was to create a civic-tech solution that helps citizens report infrastructure problems with ease.\nAs the team lead, I was responsible not only for development but also for coordinating efforts across the group. This project taught me the fundamentals of app architecture, Firebase integration, and multi-user data flow. It was also my first time building a live-updating app using cloud services.",
