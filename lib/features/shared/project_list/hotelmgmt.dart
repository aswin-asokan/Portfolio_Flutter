  aboutProject:
      "After completing the Dairy Management App, I was eager to dive deeper into Java and desktop development, so I started building the Hotel Management App to broaden my understanding of CRUD systems, pricing logic, and real-world data handling.\nI worked on this project with help from my friend Najiya, who assisted in defining the required UI structure and feature set. Her input helped shape a functional, user-focused system. This project became a great opportunity to level up my skillset by handling a more complex use case than before.",
